    "\n",
    "* The widget loses which tab is selected on refresh\n",
    "* You can only progress forward in time, and only from a known-good point in the history\n",
    "* You need to re-enter the experiment config as part of the `restore_state_from_replay` call\n",
    "* Not all Griduniverse features are supported\n",
    "* Older Griduniverse exports do not display chat history\n",
    "* The teardown code is not working correctly. You will not be able to run cell 1 twice \n",
    "  within the same kernel. You must shut down your jupyter notebook server and restart\n",
    "  in order to run it again."
